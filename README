Fffx: adjust ffmpeg effects while playing.

Schism Tracker can diskwrite each channel of a song to a wav file. For a mix, I
want to tweak bandpass, gain and reverb of each individual sample while hearing
them all together. Then I'll copy each sample, apply its resulting effect
settings, and use that in place of the dry original.

Depending on SDL2 and ffmpeg, I'll be writing such a utility here. For
development convenience, I'll use a Makefile, clang-format and git.

  git clone https://github.com/nykula/fffx
  cd fffx
  make
  ./fffx ~/*.wav
